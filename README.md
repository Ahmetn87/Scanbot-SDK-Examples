# Scanbot-SDK-Examples

#### How it works?

Check out our Wiki: https://github.com/doo/Scanbot-SDK-Examples/wiki

#### How do I get the license?

You can run examples and even develop your app without a license. If you do not specify the license in `AndroidManifest` then SDK will work in trial mode (currently, for 1 minute). If it's not enough for you, contact us at sdk@scanbot.io and we'll give you a free trial license for longer period.

#### What is the latest version of the SDK?

Current version is 1.3.0

#### Why example is not working / stopped working

Either your trial period is expired or you set the license incorrectly. Please, double check that.
